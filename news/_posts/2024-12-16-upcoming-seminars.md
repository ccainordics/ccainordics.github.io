Climate AI Nordics is thrilled to announce coming seminars in early 2025, featuring a lineup of esteemed researchers who are driving innovation in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to address climate change. These seminars will explore AI applications for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, in alignment with our mission to foster work that address the pressing challenges of our climate emergency.

The first seminar, on January 30, 2025, will feature **Amal Nammouchi**, a PhD candidate at Karlstad University and co-founder of [AfriClimate AI](https://www.africlimate.ai/). Amal’s work focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) and deep reinforcement learning for transparent and trustworthy decision-making. She works on multimodal machine learning for climate challenges in energy management.

On February 20, 2025, **Abdulhakim Abdi** from Lund University will present his research on the application of AI and machine learning to Earth observation data. Dr. Abdi, a senior researcher at the Centre for Environmental and Climate Science, studies natural ecosystems and their response to environmental change. His seminar will provide insights into how these tools can monitor ecosystem in the current biodiversity crisis.

The series continues on March 6, 2025, with a presentation by **Atakan Aral**, an Assistant Professor at the University of Vienna. Professor Aral specializes in distributed systems, edge computing, and resource allocation, with a focus on the development of AI-driven environmental monitoring systems. 

*His seminar will explore how early warning systems powered by AI can detect environmental hazards such as river pollution, enabling rapid response to mitigate their impact.*

On March 13, 2025, **Sherrie Wang**, Assistant Professor at MIT, will share her expertise in using AI to monitor agricultural systems. As the leader of the Earth Intelligence Lab, Dr. Wang focuses on developing computational algorithms to support sustainable development. Her talk will examine how AI can improve agricultural management and mitigate climate change, particularly in low- and middle-income regions.

The next seminar, on March 27, 2025, will be delivered by **María J. Molina**, an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland. Professor Molina’s research applies machine learning tools and numerical modeling systems to critical climate science questions, including the prediction of extreme weather events. Her presentation will delve into how AI can enhance our understanding of these events and provide actionable insights to inform both mitigation and adaptation strategies.

This seminar series brings together diverse perspectives on how AI can be harnessed to address the challenges of climate change. Amal Nammouchi and Abdulhakim Abdi will highlight the importance of using AI to build resilience in vulnerable regions, ensuring societies can adapt to the effects of climate change. Sherrie Wang and María Molina will showcase AI’s role in mitigating climate change by improving climate predictions and supporting sustainable practices. Meanwhile, Atakan Aral will emphasize the technological innovations that enable real-time environmental monitoring and hazard detection.

By connecting these thought leaders, Climate AI Nordics aims to foster collaboration and inspire the development of AI solutions that tackle both the causes and consequences of climate change. These seminars provide a platform for researchers, policymakers, and the public to engage with cutting-edge research and contribute to the global effort against climate change.

Stay tuned for registration details and further updates on each seminar. Join us to explore how AI can help us navigate one of humanity’s greatest challenges.
