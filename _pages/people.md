Welcome to _Climate Change AI Nordics_.
We're a [network of researchers](https://ccai.cc/people/) who work on problems related to tackling climate change using AI and machine learning. CCAIN acts as a hub, hosting and announcing news, seminars, and workshops. [Join us](/join/)!

<span title="Mogren defended his PhD in computer science at Chalmers University of Technology in 2018 with the thesis Representation Learning for Natural Language. Senior researcher, head of the https://dl-group.se, and responsible for deep learning research at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. Olof develops and investigates machine learning based solutions to problems related to the environment and climate change. This includes stream flow forecasting, soundscape analysis for biodiversity monitoring, and AI for circular business models."><strong>Olof Mogren, RISE</strong></span>
