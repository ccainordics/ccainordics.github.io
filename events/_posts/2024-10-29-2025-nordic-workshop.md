Join us for The 2025 Nordic Workshop on AI for Tackling Climate Change, the first but hopefully not the last of workshops on the topic where we gather researchers from the Nordics. This one-day, in-person workshop, will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden, May 13th 2025. The workshop will feature a mix of keynotes, oral presentations, and posters around the topics of AI for climate change, including AI for biodiversity and the green transition. The workshop will be a meeting point for a wide range of researchers from (primarily) around the Nordic countries, but other interested people will be welcome too.

The workshop is organized by [CLIMES, The Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes](https://climes.se/) in collaboration with [RISE](https://ri.se/) and [Climate Change AI Nordics, CCAIN](https://ccain.cc/). The day will end with a poster session and dinner.

The first 80 participants will register for free, while further attendees will have to cover the cost for their seat.

More information will follow soon.
