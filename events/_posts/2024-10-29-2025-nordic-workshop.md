Extreme events following climate change are getting ever more frequent. Humanity needs to tackle the new reality on a changing planet on many fronts. Many of the approaches which are in use or under development can be strengthened using advanced analytics tools and optimization techniques. The 2025 Nordic Workshop on AI for Tackling Climate Change will gather researchers from the Nordics. This one-day, in-person workshop, will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden, May 13th 2025. The workshop will feature a mix of keynotes, oral presentations, and posters around the topics of AI for climate change, including AI for biodiversity and the green transition. The workshop will be a meeting point for a wide range of researchers from (primarily) around the Nordic countries, but other interested people will be welcome too.

Together, we will help the Nordic AI community to find the most impactful directions of future research in the field.

**Topics:**

The workshop will feature presentations about Earth observation, computer vision, soundscape analysis, natural language processing, geometric machine learning, optimization, natural language processing, and multimodal modeling for climate related applications. Applications in green infrastructure, species distribution modeling, biodiversity monitoring.

We invite **poster presentations**. In addition to the topics mentioned above, we also welcome presentations about the following topics.

* The role of policy change
* The use of AI to tackle climate change within
    - built environments
    - transport
    - material
    - product development
* AI method developments that benefits AI applications within climate change mitigation and adaptation

**Speakers:**

**Oisin Mac Aodha**, University of Edinburgh

*Stefanos Georganos is an Associate Professor in Geomatics at Karlstad University. He does research in quantitative human geography, remote sensing, spatial epidemiology, demography and machine learning. He is particularly interested in the use of geo-information for helping address the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a geographical interest in sub-Saharan African cities. His latest research unravels the potential of machine and deep learnning and Earth Observation to detect, measure and characterize socio-economic inequalities in deprived urban areas in support of the most vulnerable populations.*

**Edmond Sacre**, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

*Shorouq Zahra a research engineer and developer at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, with a focus on NLP, conversational AI, and MLOps. She has been engaged in the work "Using LLMs to Build a Database of Climate Extreme Impacts", presented at ClimateNLP 2024, proposing a method for building large-scale databases of climate extreme impacts from online textual sources, using LLMs for information extraction in combination with more traditional NLP techniques to improve accuracy and consistency.*

**Alouette van Hove**, University of Oslo

![](/events/2025-nordic-workshop/van-hove.jpg)

*Alouette van Hove is a PhD candidate at the University of Oslo. Her research interests includes the development of a novel framework to estimate land surface fluxes at a regional scale. The framework makes use of sensor measurements from drones, data assimilation, atmospheric fluid dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to deliver high-resolution surface maps of greenhouse gas fluxes in northern landscapes for validation of climate models.*

More speakers will be added soon.

**Date and time:** 2025-05-13, 09:00-18:00 + Social dinner until late

**Place:** Gothenburg, Sweden

The workshop is organized by [CLIMES, The Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes](https://climes.se/) in collaboration with [Climate Change AI Nordics](https://ccainordics.com/). The day will end with a poster session and dinner.

**Pricing**

The first 80 participants will register for free, while further attendees will have to cover the cost for their seat. **A limited number of students can be reimbursed for travel and hotel for the workshop. Please provide a clear and concise motivation for this and a calculation of the costs for your trip, and send this to olof.mogren@ri.se by end of February 2025. Students will be chosen based on their research performance and their provided motivation.**
