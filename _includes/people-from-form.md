<span title="I lead a research group at the intersection of medicine, environmental science and data science. We develop tools for text and image analysis and knowledge integration and apply them to research questions in medicine and environmental science. I also lead the computational research school COMPUTE and the &quot;AI in Medicine and Life Science&quot; focus area in AI Lund. Besides this, I am very engaged in open science and public outreach.
