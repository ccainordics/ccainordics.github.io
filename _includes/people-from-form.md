<span title="I am a lecturer in Urban Planning at the University of Auckland, bringing over 13 years of experience in both research and practice. My focus is on addressing climate change challenges, enhancing urban resilience, promoting regeneration, and advocating for environmental justice. I am particularly interested in understanding and mitigating the risks that urban areas encounter, especially those related to climate change and natural hazards. My research examines how cities can adapt to these increasing threats, emphasising resilience, risk reduction, and sustainable planning to protect communities and infrastructure.
