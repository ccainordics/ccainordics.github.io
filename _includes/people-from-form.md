<span title="My research consistently targets the physical mechanisms that enable climate predictability. This includes understanding how tropical dynamics influence atmospheric circulation over the Western Arctic and the North Atlantic-European sector. I have developed an experimental teleconnection-based seasonal prediction system at SMHI, designed to make teleconnections operationally useful for seasonal forecasting. This system exemplifies his ability to translate scientific discoveries into practical tools for climate.  I contribute to making a physically based application of machine learning methods to improve climate predictability, for example, designing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for various applications: 1) downscaling coarse-resolution datasets, 2)detecting extreme events in large datasets, and 3) improving seasonal forecasts.
